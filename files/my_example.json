     "text": "In Hinduism, an avatar (Sanskrit, IAST) means \"descent\", and colloquially refers to the appearance or incarnation of a deity on Earth. The term also generally refers to \"alight, to make one's appearance\" and sometimes used to refer to any revered guru or human being. The word avatar does not appear in the Vedic literature, appears in verb forms in post-Vedic literature, and as a noun particularly in the Puranic literature after the 6th-century CE. An early reference to incarnation doctrine is found in the Bhagavad Gita but with terms other than avatar."

The film is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the mineral unobtanium, a room-temperature superconductor. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi – a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The film's title refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body with the mind of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora."

The first film released in the MCU was Iron Man (2008), which began the first phase of films culminating in the crossover film Marvel's The Avengers (2012). Phase Two began with Iron Man 3 (2013), and concluded with Ant-Man (2015). The films are currently in Phase Three, which began with the release of Captain America: Civil War (2016). Marvel Television expanded the universe further, first to network television with Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in the 2013–14 television season, followed by online streaming with Marvel's Daredevil on Netflix in 2015, and then to cable television with Marvel's Cloak and Dagger, which is scheduled to air in 2017 on Freeform.
